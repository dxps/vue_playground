## Setup & Usage

Run: 

- `pnpm i` to install the dependencies
- `pnpm run serve` for compiling and hot reloading during development.
- `pnpm run build` for doing (incl minification) the production build.
- `pnpm run list --fix` for linting and fixes (according to `.eslintrc.js`)<br/>
  To use the same 4 spaces indentation, added also the VSCode setting `"editor.detectIndentation": false`
